## Configuration

Configure Swift Conductor API URL like this: 

```python
from swift_conductor.configuration import Configuration

configuration = Configuration(
    server_api_url='http://localhost:8080/api',
    debug=True
)
```

* server_api_url : Swift Conductor API URL. For example, if you are running a local server the URL will look like this `http://localhost:8080/api`.
* debug: Set to `True` for verbose logging and `False` to print only errors.

## Metrics Configuration for WorkerHost (Optional)

Swift Conductor uses [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to collect metrics.

```python
metrics_settings = MetricsSettings(
    directory='/path/to/folder',
    file_name='metrics_file_name.extension',
    update_interval=0.1,
)
```

* `directory`: Directory to store the metrics. Ensure that you have already created this folder, or the program should have permission to create it for you.
* `file_name`: File where the metrics are stored. Example: `metrics.log`
* `update_interval`: Time interval in seconds to refresh metrics into the file. Example: `0.1` means metrics are updated every  0.1s or 100ms.

Pass the `MetricsSettings` object to the `WorkerHost` constructor.
